# S76_WierdEats

Welcome to the *S76_WieredEats*, this is a hands-on project where I will build a website where pepole can share the experience on wierd food combinations and also like (or) commenting others preferences using the MERN stack(MongoDB,Express.js,React.js, and Node.js). The goal is to learn how to develop a full-stack web application step by step.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview 
WeirdEats is a web application where users can share, explore, and rate bizarre food combinations. From pineapple on pizza to chocolate-dipped pickles, the app serves as a hub for food enthusiasts to celebrate the unexpected, strange, and oddly delicious. Users can log in, create their own lists of weird food combos, and view lists from others. The project aims to bring humor and curiosity into the world of food exploration.

#### 1.Understanding the MERN Stack:
*MongoDB :* A Database for storing application data ina felexible , document based format.
*Express.js :* A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling serve logics.
*React.js :* A framework library for building user Interfaces.
*Node.js :* A runtime environment that allows javascript to run on the server.

#### 2. REST API Structure
REST APIs are used to allow communicaton btween the frontend and backend.
we'll create APIs for :
- *User Authentication*: Allowing users to register and log in .
- *Like Management*: like and Unlike Specific compination.
- *comment Handling*:Managing customer comments.

#### 3. Database Schema Design 
WE'll learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB . A schema helps us define how the data is stored and related.

#### 4. Authentication 
Authentication ensures only the right people can access certain features. For example:
- Users need to log in to share their liked or weird food combination.
- It keeps the app secure by verifying users' identities.
