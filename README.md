# S76_WeirdEats

Welcome to *S76_WeirdEats*! This is a hands-on project where I will build a website where people can share their experiences with weird food combinations and also like or comment on others' preferences using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The goal is to learn how to develop a full-stack web application step by step.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

WeirdEats is a web application where users can share, explore, and rate bizarre food combinations. From pineapple on pizza to chocolate-dipped pickles, the app serves as a hub for food enthusiasts to celebrate the unexpected, strange, and oddly delicious. Users can log in, create their own lists of weird food combos, and view lists from others. The project aims to bring humor and curiosity into the world of food exploration.

### 1. Understanding the MERN Stack
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing application data in a flexible, document-oriented format.
- **Express.js:** A lightweight backend framework for building APIs and managing server-side logic.
- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Node.js:** A runtime environment that enables JavaScript to run on the server, powering the backend of the application.

### 2. REST API Structure
REST APIs enable seamless communication between the frontend and backend. The following APIs will be implemented:
- **User Authentication:** Provides functionality for user registration and login.
- **Like Management:** Allows users to like or unlike specific food combinations.
- **Comment Handling:** Facilitates adding, viewing, and managing user comments on food combinations.

### 3. Database Schema Design
A well-structured database schema is essential for organizing data effectively. Using MongoDB, we will:
- Define schemas that represent the relationships and attributes of various data models.
- Ensure scalability and flexibility in how data is stored and retrieved.

### 4. Authentication
Authentication plays a crucial role in securing the application and controlling access. Key features include:
- **User Verification:** Ensures users are authenticated before accessing specific features, such as sharing or liking food combinations.

- **Security Measures:** Protects sensitive user information and validates user identities to maintain the integrity of the platform.
