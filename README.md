# S76_WeirdEats

Welcome to *S76_WeirdEats*! This is a hands-on project where I will build a website where people can share their experiences with weird food combinations and also like or comment on others' preferences using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The goal is to learn how to develop a full-stack web application step by step.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

WeirdEats is a web application where users can share, explore, and rate bizarre food combinations. From pineapple on pizza to chocolate-dipped pickles, the app serves as a hub for food enthusiasts to celebrate the unexpected, strange, and oddly delicious. Users can log in, create their own lists of weird food combos, and view lists from others. The project aims to bring humor and curiosity into the world of food exploration.

### 1. Understanding the MERN Stack
- **MongoDB:** A database for storing application data in a flexible, document-based format.
- **Express.js:** A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling server logic.
- **React.js:** A library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js:** A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server.

### 2. REST API Structure
REST APIs are used to enable communication between the frontend and backend. We'll create APIs for:
- **User Authentication:** Allows users to register and log in.
- **Like Management:** Enables users to like and unlike specific combinations.
- **Comment Handling:** Manages user comments.

### 3. Database Schema Design
We'll learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB. A schema helps define how the data is stored and related.

### 4. Authentication
Authentication ensures that only the right people can access certain features. For example:
- Users need to log in to share or like weird food combinations.
- It keeps the app secure by verifying users' identities.
